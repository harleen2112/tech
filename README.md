Core Impacts

Energy
ICT accounts for ~4 % of global electricity (~223 TWh data centers + 272 TWh networks)

Water
AI‑intensive data centers use 4–6.6 billion m³/year (≈half the UK’s consumption); cooling systems stress freshwater supplies

Materials & Lifecycle
Device manufacturing (e.g. iPhone) can represent ~80 % of its carbon footprint; repairability and recycling are key
